[My portfolio site](https://github.com/Christie8allard/christie8allard.github.io)

## Project Requirements

### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 
- [X] At least one profile picture
- [X] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [X] Functional Contact Form
- [X] "Projects" section
- [X] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.

I want to keep my site streamlined and will update the "Trending" (aka Projects) page once I have these to include. I've added a section to show off a YouTube portfolio I've created previosuly. 
​
### Technical
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from? 
- [X] At least 2 web pages.
- [X] Version controlled with Git
- [X] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [X] Implements responsive design principles.
- [X] Uses semantic HTML.

I've used the trending icon in the header to link to the "Trending" page. 

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [X] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)

The colour changes in each section from a lighter grey to a darker one when you hover over it.

### Screenshots
